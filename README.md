# Code-refactor

## In index.html,
    I added a few tags that makes the code more sementic such as <header>, <footer>, <aside> and <main> .
    The <alt> attributes in the <img> are missing, so I added them.
    I also changed and added a few selectors such as class="" and id="" so that I can consolidate the code in CSS.

## In style.css,
    I look for the similar properties' value such as color, font-family, font-size, etc.
    Then I consolidate all of them under one selector, and remove the repeated properties' value.
